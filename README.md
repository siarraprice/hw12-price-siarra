This was a great exercise to practice writing ES6 and using Babel to transpile. I figured out everything, but the only thing I am still unsure about is if I called the method includeSpoon() to the console properly. It is showing up, but I think I may had coded it out incorrectly. Other than that, I am confident about this exercise as a whole.
